Welcome to _Catcord_. Catcord is a minimal chat application created by the Cat Dev Team, that ships with a minimal default interface. In its essence catcord is just a set of endpoints. Anyone can create a client to interface with our endpoints. Catcord's default client is built using React.js and Tauri.
