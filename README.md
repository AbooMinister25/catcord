Welcome to _Catcord_. Catcord is a minimal chat application created by the Cat Dev Team, with no default interface, UI, or anything, just a set of endpoints. Anyone can create a client to interface with our endpoints. Catcord ships with a basic default client you can use to interact with the API, which is built using React.js and Tauri.
