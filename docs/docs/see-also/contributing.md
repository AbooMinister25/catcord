## How to contribute

Want to contribute? We're always accepting contribution on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/cat-dev-group/catcord) where you can open an
[issue](https://github.com/cat-dev-group/catcord/issues) or
[pull request](https://github.com/cat-dev-group/catcord/pulls) to make an improvement,

## Contributing Guidelines

While we're always accepting contributions, Catcord has a short but strict set of contributing
guidelines.

- Open an issue before you make a PR for a large change. We don't want your work to go to waste
if that's not a feature/change that's wanted. For smaller changes, go ahead and make them, that's
usually fine.

- Test your code. We don't want to push code that's riddled with bugs into production. Yes, we'll
test it while reviewing, but it's more work for everyone if you don't do it yourself first.
