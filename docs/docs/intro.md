## What is Catcord?

Catcord is an open-source chat application, centered around its own API. Anyone with the technical
knowledge could write a client to interact with the API. Of course, that's not necessary as Catcord
does ship with its own prebuilt frontend, which is built using [SvelteKit](https:/kit.svelte.dev/).
