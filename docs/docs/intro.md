## What is Catcord?

<<<<<<< HEAD
Catcord is an open source chat application that is built around it's custom API. The frontend and
the backend aren't built to be used only together. The frontend is a
[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) application that uses the backend API, but other than that,
they have no connection. You could build your own frontend if you wanted to, but it's not required
 as we do provide the frontend.
=======
Well, I'm glad you asked! Catcord is an open-source chat application, centered around its own API,
which anyone with the technical know-how can write a client for, in order to send and get messages.
Of course, if you don't want to do all that, Catcord *does* ship with its own prebuilt frontend,
which is built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/).
