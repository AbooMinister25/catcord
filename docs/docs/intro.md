## What is Catcord?

Catcord is an open source chat application that is built around it's custom API. The frontend and
the backend aren't built to be used only together. The frontend is a [React](https://reactjs.org/)
application that uses the backend API, but other than that, they have no connection. You could
build your own frontend if you wanted to, but it's not required as we do provide the frontend.
