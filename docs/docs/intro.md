## What is Catcord?

Well, I'm glad you asked! Catcord is an open-source chat application, centered around its own API,
which anyone with the technical know-how can write a client for, in order to send and get messages.
Of course, if you don't want to do all that, Catcord *does* ship with its own prebuilt frontend,
which is built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/).
